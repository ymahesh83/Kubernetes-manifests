# Verification Steps
# Launch the Cluster: Deploy the manifests using kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml.

# Check Pod Readiness:

# Run kubectl get pods -n default to check the status of the Pods.
# Check the logs and events to ensure that the backend Pod is reporting ready status.
# Verify the ReadinessProbe:

# kubectl exec -it <backend-pod-name> -- curl db1:6379 should succeed if db1 is reachable.
# Confirm the NetworkPolicy:

# Test if the backend Pod can access db1 on port 6379 and db2 on port 5432.
# You can use a temporary busybox Pod to test network connectivity.
# Verify the Secret:

# Execute kubectl exec -it <db2-pod-name> -- printenv | grep DB2_ to check that the environment variables are correctly populated.
# These steps will help ensure that the Kubernetes configuration meets the specified requirements and that the system is functioning as expected.
